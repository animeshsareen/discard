## Development Notes

This extension uses Chrome's Manifest V3 and requires these permissions:
- `activeTab`: To access current webpage content
- `storage`: To save your credit card data locally
- `scripting`: To inject content scripts for merchant detection

All processing happens locally in your browser for maximum privacy and security.
